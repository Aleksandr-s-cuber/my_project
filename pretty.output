  Scenario: Successfully create a note with valid data    # features/example.feature:2
    Given I have a valid note payload                     # features/steps/example_steps.py:5
    When I send a request to create the note              # features/steps/example_steps.py:9
    Then the response status code should be 200           # features/steps/example_steps.py:14
